/*
  This is a standard neural net structure
  the equivalent of the weightsGrid has to be public fo the genetic algo to work
  The 'weights' is a vector of vectors of vectors (ie a list of matrices) that represents the weights associated with each layer
  The input vector must be of size gridSize * gridSize
  The last layer must output a single number, representing the fitness of the input grid
  The 'nonLinearities' is a vector of integers, where each integer represents a non linearity (0 = linear, 1 = ReLU, 2 = tanh)
  -> tanh does not really work because it is always equal to +1 or -1
  The 'layers' is a vector of vector, with the content of each neuron
